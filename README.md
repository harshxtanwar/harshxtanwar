- 👋 Hi, I’m @harshxtanwar
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development with Python. I am comfortable with FastAPI and Django frameworks. I have worked with databases like elasticsearch, prometheus, MySQL and MongoDB. I have knowledge of REST backend architectures and GraphQL using strawberry framework. I have some experience with backend using javascript and nodeJS, and have also made some simple frontend pages using HTML and CSS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang and it's Gin framework for backend and Frontend in ReactJS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on good open-source projects which give me an exposure to new frameworks as well.
- 📫 you can contact me on my email: @harshwardhan.t12345@gmail.com
